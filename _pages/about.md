## Biography
I was born in Marino (Rome), Italy, on July 20th, 1982.  
I am currently **Associate Professor** in the Department of Enterprise Engineering at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”.  

My research investigates **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, bridging **theoretical models** and **large-scale applications**.  
It spans multiple areas, including:  

- **Large Language Models and Generative AI**: instruction tuning, continual learning, multimodal integration.  
- **Machine Learning for NLP**: kernel methods, neural networks, syntactic and semantic parsing.  
- **Semantic Search and Information Access**: fact verification, retrieval-augmented generation, adaptive IR.  
- **Human–Robot Interaction**: language understanding for robots, adaptive and context-aware interfaces.  
- **Applied AI**: sentiment analysis, epidemic intelligence, digital tourism, and domain-specific IR.  
- **Ethics and Transparency in AI**: interpretability, fairness, sustainability, and “ethics by design”.  

I serve as **Technical Lead** of the [Semantic Analytics Group (SAG)](http://sag.art.uniroma2.it/) and member of the **Artificial Intelligence at Tor Vergata (ART)** research network.

## Research Vision
My work aims to **combine rigorous machine learning theory with impactful AI systems**, addressing two central challenges: **scalability** and **responsibility**.  

I develop methods that make neural architectures more **transparent, sustainable, and multimodal**.  
Applications of my research include:  

- **Natural Language Processing**: semantic parsing, syntactic analysis, information extraction.  
- **Information Access**: semantic search, adaptive information retrieval, fact verification, retrieval-augmented generation.  
- **Social Media and Society**: sentiment and opinion mining, epidemic intelligence, digital tourism, analysis of online communities.  
- **Multimodality**: image and video captioning, visual question answering, multimodal LLMs for grounded reasoning.  
- **Human–Robot Interaction**: spoken language understanding for robots, adaptive and context-aware interfaces.  
- **Ethics and Transparency in AI**: interpretability, fairness, and “ethics by design” methodologies for neural systems.  

I also contribute to the research community by releasing **benchmarks, datasets, and open-source systems**, such as **ExtremITA**, **U-DepPLLaMA**, **MM-IGLU**, **GAN-BERT**, and **EthicalNN**.
