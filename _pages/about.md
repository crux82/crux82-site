## Biography
I was born in Marino (Rome), Italy, on July 20th, 1982.  
I am currently **Associate Professor** in the Department of Enterprise Engineering at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”.  

My research investigates **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence** with a focus on:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI  
- Kernel methods and neural networks for Natural Language Processing  
- Semantic search, fact verification, and retrieval-augmented generation  
- Human-Robot Interaction and multimodal understanding  
- Ethics and transparency in AI systems  

I am head of the **Semantic Analytics Group (SAG)** and member of the **Artificial Intelligence at Tor Vergata (ART)** group.  

## Education
- **Ph.D. in Computer Science and Control Engineering**, University of Rome “Tor Vergata” (2012).  
  Thesis: *Structured Learning for Natural Language Semantic Processing*.  
- **M.Sc. in Computer Engineering**, University of Rome “Tor Vergata” (2008, 110/110 cum laude).  
- Licensed as Professional Engineer (2009).  

## Academic Qualifications
- National Scientific Qualification (**Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale**) for *Associate Professor* in:
  - Informatics (01/B1), valid 2020–2029  
  - Computer Systems (09/H1), valid 2020–2029  

## Professional Experience
- Assistant Professor (RTD-A), University of Rome “Tor Vergata” (2015–2020).  
- Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Rome “Tor Vergata” (2012–2014).  
- Visiting Researcher, University of Colorado Boulder (2011).  
- Member of SAG and ART since 2008.  

## Research Vision
My research bridges **mathematical models of meaning** with **real-world AI systems**, addressing both **scalability and ethical responsibility**.  
I work on making neural models **transparent, sustainable, and multimodal**, advancing tasks such as semantic parsing, fact verification, sentiment analysis, and multimodal captioning.  

I am also committed to fostering **open resources and benchmarks** for the community, with contributions such as **ExtremITA, U-DepPLLaMA, MM-IGLU, GAN-BERT, EthicalNN**, and numerous datasets for Italian NLP.
