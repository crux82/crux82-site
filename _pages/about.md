## Biography
I was born in Marino (Rome), Italy, on July 20th, 1982.  
I am currently **Associate Professor** in the Department of Enterprise Engineering at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”.  

My research investigates **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on:  
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI  
- Multimodal LLMs and grounded language understanding  
- Kernel methods and neural networks for Natural Language Processing  
- Semantic search, fact verification, and retrieval-augmented generation  
- Human-Robot Interaction and adaptive interfaces  
- Ethics, transparency, and sustainability in AI systems  

I serve as **Technical Lead** of the [Semantic Analytics Group (SAG)](http://sag.art.uniroma2.it/) and member of the **Artificial Intelligence at Tor Vergata (ART)** research network.

## Research Vision
My research bridges **mathematical models of meaning** with **real-world AI systems**, addressing both **scalability** and **ethical responsibility**.  

I focus on making neural architectures **transparent, sustainable, and multimodal**, with applications to:  
- semantic parsing and syntactic analysis  
- fact verification and retrieval-augmented generation  
- sentiment and opinion mining  
- multimodal captioning and grounded reasoning  

I am committed to advancing **open resources and benchmarks** for the community, contributing systems and datasets such as **ExtremITA**, **U-DepPLLaMA**, **MM-IGLU**, **GAN-BERT**, **EthicalNN**, and Italian benchmarks for NLP, fact verification, and multimodality.
