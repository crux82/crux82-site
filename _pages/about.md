**Danilo Croce** is an **Associate Professor** at the **University of Rome “Tor Vergata”** (since **September 2025**).  
His research spans **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, 
with applications to **Information Retrieval**, **Semantic Search**, **Fact Verification**, **Human–Robot Interaction**, and **Multimodality**.

**Research highlights & topics:**
- Kernel-based and neural methods for syntactic/semantic text representations
- Transparency, ethics-by-design, and sustainability in ML/LLMs
- Few/zero-shot, multi-task, and continual learning for NLP and multimodal tasks
- Multimodal models and datasets (Image/Video Captioning, VQA; Italian resources)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search systems

**Selected open-source projects & datasets:**
- **ExtremITA** (Italian instruction-tuned LLM) — first in 9/22 tasks at EVALITA 2023  
- **U-DepPLLaMA** (LLM-based dependency parsing)  
- **MM-IGLU / MM-IGLU-IT** (multimodal grounded language understanding)  
- **FEVER-it** (Italian fact-checking), **EthicalNN**, **KeLP**, **GAN-BERT**, **GQA-IT**, **mscoco-it**, **msr-vtt-it**, **SQUAD-IT**, **ABSITA**, **SENTIPOLC**, **LU4R**
