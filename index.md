Welcome!  
I am **Danilo Croce**, Associate Professor at the University of Rome ‚ÄúTor Vergata‚Äù.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Human-Robot Interaction, and Multimodality**.  

I lead the [Semantic Analytics Group (SAG)](http://sag.art.uniroma2.it) and I am a member of the **Artificial Intelligence at Tor Vergata (ART)** research group.  

My work spans from the **theoretical foundations of semantic learning** to the **development of large-scale intelligent systems**, with strong emphasis on **epistemological transparency, ethics in AI, and multimodality**.
