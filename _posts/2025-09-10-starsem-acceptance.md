We are glad to announce that our paper  
**“Injecting Frame Semantics into Large Language Models via Prompt-Based Fine-Tuning”**  
has been accepted for presentation at **\*SEM 2025 (The Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics)**. 🎉

This work shows how **Frame Semantics** can be effectively injected into **Large Language Models** through *prompt-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning* (LoRA), improving their ability in **semantic role labeling, entailment, and frame-based reasoning**.  

Stay tuned for more details once the official program and proceedings are available!
