We are glad to announce that our paper  
**“Grounded Semantic Role Labelling from Synthetic Multimodal Data for Situated Robot Commands”**  
has been accepted for presentation at **EMNLP 2025**. 🎉

This work explores how **synthetic multimodal datasets** can support *Grounded Semantic Role Labelling* in **robotic command understanding**, advancing research at the intersection of **multimodal LLMs, semantic parsing, and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**.

Stay tuned for more details once the official program and proceedings are available!
