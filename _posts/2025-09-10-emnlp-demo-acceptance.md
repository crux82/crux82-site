We are glad to announce that our system paper  
**“Sanskrit Voyager: Unified Web Platform for Interactive Reading and Linguistic Analysis of Sanskrit Texts”**  
has been accepted for presentation at the **System Demonstrations track of EMNLP 2025**. 🎉

Sanskrit Voyager is an **open-source web platform** that makes Sanskrit texts more accessible for both learners and researchers.  
It integrates **dictionary lookup, real-time text analysis, interactive reading of 900+ texts, and advanced corpus search**, handling complex challenges such as **sandhi, compounding, and rich inflectional morphology**.  

This work is the result of a collaboration between **Giacomo De Luca, Danilo Croce, and Roberto Basili** at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”.

A demo video is available here: [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCKlW4NKJEc).  
The system will be presented live at EMNLP 2025 — stay tuned for details on the demo session! 🚀
